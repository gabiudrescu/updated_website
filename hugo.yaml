      As a product owner, my day to day job is to create bridges between (eCommerce) businesses and software development. 
      
      Starting 2020, I'm working on my own, collaborating with various companies either on bringing to life a new project or contributing to an existing one.

      I have a strong belief that the wheel doesn't need to be reinvented. The key to a successful product is finding the right wheels for the needs you identify.
